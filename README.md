A formal matrix library in Coq, which using nat-indexing-function as model.
We start from vector `vec A n`, to `mat A r c` (which is `vec (vec A c) r`).
This model is simple and easy to understand.
We can easily write definition or proof.
The known difficulty is the rewriting need extra declaration and register work.
Let's try it.
